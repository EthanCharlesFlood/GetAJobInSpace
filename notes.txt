STRETCH GOALS:
if possible extra lives in the form of referrals
shoot resumes at enemys to destroy them

GAME LOGIC;
spawn obstacle objects at different xs off the screen so they cascade in
on hit detection with obstacles clear interval of all game objects
render score and some pithy message or some horseshit whatever fuck you


HITBOXES:
hitbox algorithm: have a helper function which takes as an input
the two objects hitboxes position and with and check every frame for any collision


SCORE:
implement score in job points based on number of obstacles avoided
Constantly increment on interval and every time an obstacle or enemy object
resets increment score more

MENU:
On space render the objects neccesary to play the game and use clear interval to
remove the menu
